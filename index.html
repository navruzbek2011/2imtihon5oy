                counted as monkeys except the apes, thus monkeys (in that sense) constitute an incomplete paraphyletic
                grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making

                cat, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics
                have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly
                kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is
                valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Because of its retractable claws, it
                is adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes,
                sharp teeth, and its night.</p>

                to be domesticated[9][8] by humans. Experts estimate that hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more than
                15,000 years ago in Oberkassel, Bonn,[7] which was before the development of agriculture.</p>

                tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have
                a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few
